## General Features

### V5 dice roller

**[Main Page: Rolls](rolls.md)**

At its most basic, **Inconnu** performs standard rolls with a Pool, Hunger, and Difficulty. In addition, it allows you to perform Willpower re-rolls using one of three strategies: re-roll failures, maximize criticals, and avoid messy criticals.

However, what makes **Inconnu** unique is its combination of dice rolling and character statistics.

### Macro support

**[Main Page: Macros](macros.md)**

Macros are an advanced, time-saving feature that allows you to predefine rolls for later use. No dice roller is complete without them! **Inconnu's** macros use the same syntax as normal rolls, making macro creation a snap.

### Character tracking

**[Main Page: Character Tracking](character-tracking.md)**

**Inconnu** allows you to create as many characters as you want on as many servers as you like. You can track your Hunger, Health, Willpower, Humanity, and XP all from one central location with a simple, easy-to-use text-based interface. In addition, **Inconnu** ties into your characters with its `rouse` and `remorse` commands, saving time and reducing the need for bookkeeping.

### Skills, Attributes, and Traitsâ€”oh, my!

**[Main Page: Trait Management](trait-management.md)**

Perhaps its most unique feature, **Inconnu** allows you to track individual Attributes (such as Strength, Composure, and Intelligence) and Skills (like Academics, Brawl, and Craft), as well as enter your own, custom traits. What's more, you can then use these traits to create a dice pool. When you create a character, **Inconnu** will guide you through a thorough creation wizard.

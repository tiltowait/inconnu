# Character Miscellanea

The following commands are not necessary to actual gameplay but can assist with keeping track of characters.

## Biographies

You can set your character's biography, description, personality, and a "face claim" image using the `/character bio edit` command. To view a biography—either your characters' or another player's—use `/character bio show`.

!> Everything you type into the dialog box is public! Don't enter anything that should be secret.

## Convictions

The `/character convictions set` command lets you set up to three Convictions for your characters. Just like with biographies, you can view them with `/character convictions show`.

Note that *un*like biographies, Convictions are *not* public. Only you or an admin can view your characters' Convictions.

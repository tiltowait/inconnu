# User Privacy Policy

**Inconnu** stores Discord user IDs over everyone who uses it, as well as Discord server IDs for all servers on which it is installed. None of this data is personally identifiable and is essential for the bot's basic (and advanced) functionality.

Additionally, **Inconnu** must store character data in order to make use of its advanced features. You should not post anything personally identifiable in character names, custom traits, macro names, comments, etc., as these may be visible to other users.

**No** data is shared with third parties.

## Data Retention

Characters and all associated data may be removed with the `/character delete` command. This command is instantaneous and cannot be reversed.

Should you leave a server on which you used **Inconnu**, all of your character data will be automatically scrubbed after thirty days unless you return to the server. To hasten this process, run `/character delete` before leaving the server.

Finally, when **Inconnu** is removed from a server, *all* relevant data will be scrubbed after thirty days.
